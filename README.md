## Project:

## Self-Assessment:

The project helped me to put a lot of things we learned over the past 6 months to put into prcatice. During the phase we got to work on the Repository, Database, Machie Learning & Technology roles.

I was able to research and contribute to the team. I learnt how to google effectively during the past 6 months. :)

I had completed my Masters in Computer Applications in 2002 and completing the boot camp after almost 20 years makes me really happy about it.


## Team Assessment: 

We were a team of 4 and we learnt collaboration well. We communicated through slack, messgaes, zoom calls and in-person meetings. All the changes were done in idividual branches and pushed to main by pull request and review process.

Every team member worked on various parts of the project and we were able to achieve our goal completetion of 'Diabetes Predictor' Application in the given time period.

Special mention to our Team lead 'Saloj' For his dedication and contributions to the project.

Thanks to all my teammembers for the wonderful work!
